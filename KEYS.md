## General MIDI

Keep in mind that there is a MIDI specification as stated [here](https://www.midi.org/specifications/item/gm-level-1-sound-set).

> GM-compatible instruments must have the sounds on the keys shown here. While many current instruments also have additional sounds above or below the range show here, and may even have additional "kits" with variations of these sounds, only these sounds are supported by General MIDI Level 1 devices.
